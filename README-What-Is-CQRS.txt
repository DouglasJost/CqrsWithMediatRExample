What is CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)?
==========================================================================================
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is an architectural pattern that separates the 
read (query) and write (command) operations of an application into different models, rather 
than using a single model for both.



Key Concepts of CQRS
====================
1. Separation of Concerns
   * Commands modify data (Create, Update, Delete).
   * Queries retrieve data (Read).
   * Instead of a single database model handling both, CQRS uses separate models for commands and queries.

2.Read and Write Optimization
  * The write model is optimized for processing and storing changes.
  * The read model is optimized for querying and retrieving data efficiently.

3. Event Sourcing (Optional, but often used)
   * Instead of storing only the latest state, all changes (events) are stored as a history.
   * Helps with auditing, rollback, and debugging.



How CQRS Works
==============
1. Commands (Write Side)
   * Handled by a Command Handler.
   * Sends updates to the database (e.g., inserting a new order, updating customer info).
   * May emit events (if using Event Sourcing).

2. Queries (Read Side)
   * Uses a separate read model (often a denormalized database for fast lookups).
   * Optimized for performance (e.g., caching, precomputed views).
   * Does not modify data, only reads it.



CQRS Example in a Shopping Cart System
======================================
* Without CQRS (Traditional Approach)
    * A single database model handles both queries (reading product details) and commands (adding products to the cart).
    * This can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially under heavy loads.

* With CQRS
   * Command Model: Updates inventory, processes orders.
   * Query Model: Fetches product details, customer order history.
   * Read and write operations scale independently, improving performance.



CQRS Benefits
=============
Scalability – Read and write operations can be optimized separately.
Performance – Read models can be cached or stored in fast NoSQL databases.
Security    – Commands require authorization, queries can be public.
Flexibility – Different data storage formats (SQL for commands, NoSQL for queries).



When to Use CQRS?
=================
* Event-driven systems (e.g., real-time applications, auditing).
* Microservices architectures (each service can scale independently).
* Systems with complex business logic (e.g., financial transactions).
* High-performance read-heavy applications (e.g., e-commerce websites).

When Not to Use CQRS?
=====================
If your application is simple, using CQRS adds unnecessary complexity.
For CRUD-based applications with minimal logic, a traditional approach works fine.
